# Chairy_Picker
Code to help chose next chair at the Strong Gravity meetings at Perimeter Institute.

Each person at the meeting is associated with an integer. At the end of the meeting an integer is picked from a semi Gaussian distribution, the lower the integer a person has, the more likely they are to be picked as the next chair.
